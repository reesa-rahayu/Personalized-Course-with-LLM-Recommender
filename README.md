## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a system that can recommend online courses to students based on their individual profiles, learning preferences, interests, and past course engagement. By combining retrieval-based methods (using embeddings and FAISS) with a generative LLM, the system aims to provide highly relevant and contextually rich recommendations.

## Features

-   **Student Profile Embedding:** Creates vector representations of student profiles including demographics, learning styles, and preferred topics.
-   **Course Description Embedding:** Generates vector representations of course details for efficient similarity search.
-   **FAISS Indexing:** Uses FAISS to create an efficient index of course embeddings for fast retrieval of similar courses.
-   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieved relevant course information with the student's full profile to augment the LLM prompt.
-   **Personalized Recommendations:** Generates personalized course recommendations with explanations using an LLM.
-   **Data Synthesis:** Includes code to generate synthetic student, course, and enrollment data for demonstration and testing.
-   **Data Exploration:** Provides basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the synthetic datasets.

## Methodology

The system follows these steps:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Synthetic data for students, courses, and enrollments is generated. Categorical features are encoded, and text representations for students and courses are created for embedding.
2.  **Knowledge Base Creation:** Course descriptions are embedded using a pre-trained sentence transformer model (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). These embeddings are indexed using FAISS.
3.  **Retrieval:** When a recommendation is needed for a student, their profile is converted into an embedding. A similarity search is performed on the FAISS index to retrieve the most relevant courses based on the embedding similarity.
4.  **Prompt Augmentation:** The retrieved course information is combined with the student's full profile (including historical data) to create an augmented prompt for the LLM.
5.  **Generation:** A Large Language Model (e.g., Flan-T5 Base) takes the augmented prompt and generates personalized course recommendations with explanations.

## Data

The project uses synthetically generated data. The following CSV files are generated in the `data` directory:

-   `students.csv`: Contains synthetic student information.
-   `courses.csv`: Contains synthetic course information.
-   `enrollments.csv`: Contains synthetic student enrollment data.
-   `merged_data.csv`: Contains a merged view of student, course, and enrollment data.

The key columns used for the recommendation system include:

-   **Students:** `student_id`, `age`, `gender`, `education_level`, `learning_style`, `preferred_topics`, `completed_course_history`.
-   **Courses:** `course_id`, `course_title`, `topic`, `difficulty`, `duration_hours`, `description`, `prerequisites`.
-   **Enrollments:** `enrollment_id`, `student_id`, `course_id`, `enrollment_date`, `completion_rate`, `time_spent_hours`, `status`, `rating`.

## Usage

1.  **Run the notebook:** Execute the code cells in the provided Jupyter Notebook or Colab notebook sequentially.
    -   The notebook will first install the necessary libraries.
    -   It will then generate the synthetic data and save it to the `data` directory.
    -   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be performed and visualizations displayed.
    -   The RAG model components will be set up, including embedding courses and creating the FAISS index.
    -   A simulation of the retrieval and LLM generation process for a sample student will be demonstrated.
    -   An evaluation of the retriever's performance will be presented.
2.  **Inspect the outputs:** Review the generated dataframes, visualizations, and the output of the LLM generation to understand the system's behavior.
3.  **Modify and Experiment:** You can modify the code to:
    -   Generate different synthetic data.
    -   Use a different embedding model.
    -   Adjust the number of retrieved courses (`k_retrieved`).
    -   Experiment with different LLM parameters or models (if available and compatible).
    -   Implement a different evaluation strategy.

## Evaluation

The project includes a basic evaluation of the retriever component using metrics like Precision@K, Recall@K, and NDCG@K. It's important to note that:

-   The current evaluation is based on a simplified definition of "relevant" courses for synthetic data.
-   A comprehensive evaluation would require a more robust ground truth, potentially involving human judgment or real-world user interaction data.
-   The evaluation of the LLM's recommendation quality (beyond retrieval) would require qualitative analysis of the generated recommendations.

The initial evaluation results might appear low, which is expected with synthetic data and a simplified relevance definition. The primary purpose of this section in the notebook is to demonstrate how one might begin to evaluate such a system.

## Future Work

Possible areas for future improvement and expansion include:

-   **Using real-world data:** Integrate the system with actual student and course data.
-   **Hybrid Recommendation Approaches:** Combine the RAG approach with other methods like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering for potentially better results.
-   **Improving Embedding:** Experiment with different or fine-tuned embedding models for student profiles and courses.
-   **Advanced Retrieval:** Explore more sophisticated FAISS index types or other vector search libraries.
-   **LLM Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune the LLM on a dataset of student-course interactions and desired recommendation styles.
-   **User Interface:** Develop a simple web interface or API to interact with the recommendation system.
-   **More Robust Evaluation:** Implement a more comprehensive evaluation framework, potentially including A/B testing in a production environment.
